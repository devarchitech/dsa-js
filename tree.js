/*
Tree - is a representation of hierarchical data structure 
that has elements (data) called nodes connected by edges.

Node values cannot have duplicates.

Full Tree - each node has either no child nodes or
exactly has two nodes.

Perfect Tree - all nodes are completely filled with 
all leaf nodes at the same level.

Complete Tree - all nodes are possibly filled and if at all 
there are any gaps, they are on the right side. so the tree
is left leaning
