/*

arrow functions and methods cannot be constructed. 
Async functions, generator functions, and async generator functions are not constructible regardless of syntax.
The function declaration creates functions that are hoisted. Other syntaxes do not hoist the function and the function value is only visible after the definition.
The arrow function and Function() constructor always create anonymous functions, which means they can't easily call themselves recursively. One way to call an arrow function recursively is by assigning it to a variable.
The arrow function syntax does not have access to arguments or this.
The Function() constructor cannot access any local variables â€” it only has access to the global scope.
The Function() constructor causes runtime compilation and is often slower than other syntaxes.
